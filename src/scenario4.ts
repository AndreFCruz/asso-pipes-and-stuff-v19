/*

Multiple publishers, multiple subscribers;
Both have specialized queues:
    Inbound and Outbound;
    Broker manages queue binding;
    Broker moves messages around (between queues);
    Queues may be persistent;
No implicit connections between subscribers and producers:
    Explicit subscription;
    Identification mechanism is needed (keys, topics, ...);
    Study the Registry and (if you are feeling adventurous) the Service Locator patterns.
